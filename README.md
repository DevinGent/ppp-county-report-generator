# PPP County Report Generator
The aim of this project is to create a program which will analyze publicly available U.S. PPP (Payroll Protection Program) data for a given county.  

## Content Overview

### perm_data
This folder contains two files which are necessary for the creation of reports.  The first, `ppp2fips.csv`, is a CSV file which associates fips codes to county names. The second is a template for the README file to be included within each report.

### temp_data
This folder contains a subfolder for each county report that has been generated. For more details on the contents of these subfolders, please see the README that is contained in each.

### scripts
The script `datasets.py` contains functions to compile data from the U.S. Small Business Administration for further analysis.  The Jupyter Notebook `county_report_generator.ipynb` calls `datasets.py` to access data, then create a full county report. The Notebook contains information on how to customize reports and choose counties.

## How to Create Reports
Reports can be generated by downloading this entire folder and then running `county_report_generator.ipynb`. To select which county to create a report for you must first look up the FIPS code of the county and then enter it in the cell under the header `Choose Target FIPS Here`. 
>[!NOTE]  
>Loading the data from the SBA website takes considerable time. If a user wants to generate multiple reports it is best to: 1. Select a FIPS code, enter it, then run the Jupyter Notebook. 2. Without exiting return to the cell `Choose Target FIPS Here` and select a new FIPS code. 3. Execute that cell and all below it in order (avoiding the need to re-execute the earlier cells where the data is loaded).

More details on using the generator can be found in the comments within `county_report_generator.ipynb`.
